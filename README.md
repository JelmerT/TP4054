# Library for TP4054 Standalone Linear Li-lon Battery Charger

THIS LIBRARY IS IN BETA, it might need work for reliable results

## What does this library do?
It can detect the status of your TP4054 chip (`CHARGING`, `AC_POWER`, `UNDER_VOLTAGE_LOCK_OUT`) if you connected it to your processor in the correct way. (get and set pins, see datasheet of TP4054)
It also supports a third pin connected to VBAT via a voltage devider to get a rough estimate of level of charge.
